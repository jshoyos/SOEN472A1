Question 11
a)  According to the distribution of the classes we believe the best metric suited to this dataset is the accuracy.
In fact, the dataset is well balanced meaning there is not a big difference between the number of instances in each class is not very big,
and all the classes have the same importance in this situation. Because of these reasons we consider the accuracy to be a good metric.
